# How to Contribute

Always happy to get issues identified and pull requests!

## General considerations

1. Keep it small. The smaller the change, the more likely we are to accept.
2. Changes that fix a current issue get priority for review.
3. Check out [GitHub guide][submit-a-pr] if you've never created a pull request before.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch for your changes

This last step is very important, don't start developing from `main,` it'll cause pain if you need to send another change later.

TIP: If you're working on a GitHub issue, name your branch after the issue number, e.g. `issue-123-<ISSUE-NAME>`. This will help us keep track of what you're working on. If there is not an issue with
what you're working on, create one first, please. Someone else might be working on the same thing, or we might have a reason for not wanting to do it.
